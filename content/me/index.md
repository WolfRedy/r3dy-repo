## Introduction

I'm currently a student in the first year of the engineering cycle at ESIEA Paris as an apprentice. I work for THALES as an attack/defence scenario design engineer in cybersecurity.I'm passionate about IT and cybersecurity, and am interested in **malware analysis**, **hardware** and **Pentest/Redteam**!

    To validate my 2nd year at the IUT, I was able to do a 3-month work placement at THAMES AVS. My job was to use an existing application to implement new functions. Using VBA and bash, this application communicates with various laboratory instruments in order to carry out tests.

    The IUT enabled me to acquire a solid technical grounding in Network and IT development. I learned to code in C, Java, python, PHP, PL/SQL, HTML-CSS-JS and perl. The network and computer architecture courses confirmed my decision to go into Cybersecurity and go to engineering school.
